# Real Analysis â€” Self Study

This repository contains my self-study notes on real analysis, based on multiple textbooks including *Understanding Analysis* by Stephen Abbott.  
Exercises are written in Markdown with LaTeX, and theorems are formally proved using the Lean theorem prover.

Currently focused solely on real analysis; other topics and books will be added later.  
The project is ongoing and will be updated as I progress.
